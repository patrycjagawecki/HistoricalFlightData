 # **Historical Flight Data Warehouse**

Data Requirements:
Data: Historical Flight Schedules API by Aviation Edge
Source: https://aviation-edge.com/developers/#historicala
The data will be sourced using a REST API.

Business Requirements: 
I plan to enter the airline market by opening a US-based airline company with global routes. However, I want to stand out from my competitors by researching where delays are more frequent, allowing my company to improve operational efficiency and enhance the customer experience when traveling. Below, I have provided a few business requirements I would like to explore:
Which arrival and departure destinations have seen the most delays historically? (I will explore this business requirement to identify patterns in delays to increase customer satisfaction.)
What patterns are seen in common routes with flight cancellations? (My company will focus on ensuring that there will be minimized cancellations with commonly cancelled routes, so that my airline is more reliable to customers than my competitors.)
What are the most common departure times domestically and internationally? (I will research flight schedules to identify peak travel times and demand. If more flights are scheduled at a certain time, it means other airlines have planned those departures to meet high demand.)

Functional Requirements:
I will display my extensive research in a variety of ways. Below, I have provided a list of my functional requirements:
The system must be able to pull accurate and updated data from an API successfully, including details such as airline, departure and arrival, date, times, statuses, and delays.
The system must be capable of handling large volumes of historical flight data and ensure that there are quick response times for data retrieval.
Dashboard will provide insightful visuals that will support my business requirements, including insights on flight performance, delays, cancellations, departure and arrival times, and other operational insights. I will allow an extensive amount of filtering and drilling down to view data on specific times and airports.
